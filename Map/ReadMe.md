## Current status of Map

map_fumction_definition.py contains code for the map's functions as a reference. Created to the build_airport_map() function.  

map_function.py tries to inegrate the main with the UI using flask. 
- Has  a map POST endpoint that should accept JSON data to renders the map dynamically.
- This needs editing editing
- We may need to change the required_columns under the normalize_airport_data(data) function depending on what data would be provided by model.
